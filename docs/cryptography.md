## Hashing

We use BLAKE3 in unkeyed hashing mode, producing a 256-bit digest.

Rationale:
* This is a very fast hash function with 128-bit security. It is even sometimes faster in software than
hardware versions of SHA-256, and is about 14x as fast as software versions of SHA-256.  It is highly
parallelizable and can take advantage of vector instructions.
* It's predecessor BLAKE was the most analyzed algorithm during the NIST SHA-3 competition.
* Keyed hashing with the signing public key would include that material twice (it is already in the input)

## Digital Signature

We use EdDSA with the ed25519 curve and very specific public key and signature validation checks.
In particular:

* Public keys should be rejected if they are one of 8 small order points.
* Signatures must be rejected if s is not within the range 0..L-1.
* Signatures must be rejected if R or A are non-canonical (e.g. verify that |R| >= L and |A| >= L)
* Always use cofactor verification (8(S · B) − 8R − 8(h · A) = 0) not the non-cofactor one, even
  when not in batch mode.

Rationale:
* Fast and space efficient
* Widely studied
* Very good resistance to side-channel attacks
* Does not require point validation
* In our form, provides the following guarantees:
  * Existentially and Strongly unforgeable under chosen message attacks
  * Strongly Binding Signature
* Interoperates with TLS, Mainline DHT, and other modern ed25519-based identity systems

## Encryption

Records in Mosaic are generally not encrypted, but public things. However some applications have a need to encrypt data.

This is a general specification of how encryption is done.

This is TBD but we intend:

* To use ECIES
* To do the diffie-hellman between
    * an ephemeral keypair generated by the sender and used only once, and
    * one of the recipient's x25519 public keys (published in their key schedule), which is not ephemeral
      but may nonetheless be frequently rolled over by the recipient.

In order for a user to decrypt on any of their devices, they must share the x25519 public key's secret
to all of their devices.  We recommend using an encryption-only subkey pair for this purpose, which is
not used in ed25519 signing.  See [keyschedule](keyschedule.md) marker 0x2.
